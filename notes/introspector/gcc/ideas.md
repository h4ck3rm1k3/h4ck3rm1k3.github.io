# What is an AST to the compiler? 
What if we treat the different AST in the compiler as different domain specific languages. 
In the gcc there are a large set of functions and types dealing with trees.
There are a lot of low level details in there, 
but if we try and abstract them we might get to the idea of a domain specific language where we perform operations on those trees.
